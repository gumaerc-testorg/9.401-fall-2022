### The Tool

*Practical skills assignment*

1. Use a tool for making a dynamic executable document (R Markdown; Jupiter Notebook; Matlab Notebook) to write this week's assignment. In your executable document, use your own data (or data from another paper) to make at least one reproducible figure. 
2. {{% resource_link "5ccd9e9e-59bc-4d3c-81ff-de2b29a494a3" "Zotero has partnered with Retraction Watch" %}} to automatically flag retracted papers in a user's repository. Download {{% resource_link "10a8ccc0-8f2b-42ed-a537-8c38f934bca8" "Zotero" %}} if you do not already have it, and either import a repository from your current citation manager or manually import a few papers of your choice if you do not use a citation manager. Look through one of your repositories, and see if any papers are flagged as retracted. If not, add a retracted paper (you can find many on {{% resource_link "76a8c857-72f1-4cce-a5eb-e49f8ff23752" "Retraction Watch's database" %}}) to the repository. Is it correctly flagged as retracted? Do you think this flag is noticeable enough to be a useful tool in preventing the use of retracted papers?

In part 2 of your response paper, describe what you did in fulfilling this activity. What snags did you hit? What made this process easier or more difficult? Did you find any errors?
