## The Tool

*Practical skills assignment*

1. Do a diversity audit for the syllabus of this class, This is a {{% resource_link "124f3013-7404-400c-88b7-d4e6083dc4b0" "machine-readable bibliography of the main texts \[TXT\]" %}}, and for a bibliography in a paper by you or from your lab.  {{% resource_link "3b37c50b-d0c1-4509-938e-9ad80628a09e" "One option for code and instructions is here" %}} (you may need {{% resource_link "82856424-2421-4a1b-83d8-84f5f4a82cf9" "this template file \[TEX\]" %}} as well because it checks it against a manuscript) or {{% resource_link "24f73368-27f8-44a9-9c48-777aa74f2486" "another version is here" %}}.
2. Suggest one replacement for an assigned reading or resource that would increase the diversity of authors in this class's syllabus in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, geography, or institution, e.g. researchers working in the global south or at HBCUs (Historically black colleges and universities).
3. Find a paper you could cite in your next paper, that is topically relevant and would increase the diversity of authors in your bibliography, by gender, race/ethnicity, geography, or institution. 
4. Read PANNING pdf, practice at least one of the 'engaging skills' at the end of the pdf, in a meeting, class, or on Twitter etc. {{% resource_link "fbe4ea12-5cc6-414b-9eb6-56d067226f78" "PANNING Excercise (PDF)" %}} on pp 3-4. 
5. Look into the DEI work that MIT and BCS are doing, by looking at the {{% resource_link "9d279a47-2e89-4c82-8917-f4f598b30ba9" "BCS DEIJ website" %}}, the {{% resource_link "eb690e79-d6e8-4437-b0f0-e7e5668948a4" "School of Science website" %}}, the {{% resource_link "3aae0a51-1217-4c52-9145-b4ea9ac93387" "ICEO website" %}}, and/or the {{% resource_link "c8834895-3a81-4217-95a5-cd2b07babb60" "institutional research dashboard" %}}.  Did you find anything surprising? Programs or resources you wish more people knew about? Anything that should be there but isn't?
